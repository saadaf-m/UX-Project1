# Google UX Project 1
The purpose of this repository is to track and journal my progress building out a UX Design project following Google's UX Design Certificate course on Coursera. Throughout this project in particular, I will apply _The Design Thinking Framework_ on top of the _Product Development Life Cycle_ as a guideline to build out the product. 

To recap, the Design Thinking Framework is a user-centered approach to problem-solving that consists of the phases: 
- Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype, Test
  
But note that this is cyclical, just like the PDLC. Recap the stages of the PDLC:
- Brainstorm, Define, Design, Test, Launch
  
<br>
I will treat this repository informally, like a journal.

# Phase 1: Brainstorm
The brainstorming phase is when the team starts thinking of an idea for a product. This was partially done for me considering that the course highly suggested that I select a prompt from a list of 25 prompts so that I can best follow along with the course. I selected **#21: Design an app and a responsive website that help small business owners send and track invoices for their services.** But beyond that, the rest was on my shoulders. After I decided on a prompt, next was to begin identifying problems that I wanted to solve. <br><br>
So, I initiated this phase first by conducting user research. The user research began with conducting user interviews in person with real business owners, then by doing a competitor analysis on the highest rated business management app for small business owners. <br><br>
I initiated the user interviews segment by creating research goals. For instance, what their workflow looks like when managing invoices, are there pain points, what would they improve if they could? The competitor analysis _began_ with my goal of determining if there were already similar products available in the market. Through a long and extensive analysis of both types of user research, I learned an incredible amount more than I would have thought, both with myself and how to better conduct user interviews and competitor analysis. See the journal entries for more information on that, but in short, I had initially originally not known how to conduct either of them, but doing so and on my own, I just put myself in the deep end and learned how to. Before I set out to research, I originally kept in mind the importance in which that **you want your product to fill a gap in the market or solve a problem better than existing products.** And that is true and I have accomplished that. In the process of doing so, I learned how successful products solved the problems in the market, many of which I was trying to solve. In other words, I learned how an app like Paymo uses UX patterns effectively to solve specific invoice management problems for small business owners. I learned effective visual hierarchy principles. A competitor analysis obviously requires you to take notes so that you can synthesize your learnings into actionable insights. While conducting the analysis, I learned all the major laws of UX so I could put a name to what pattern was being applied. With user surveys, I learned a lot about building relationships with strangers and conveying your message in the best way possible so that business owners will open up to you about their nuggets of wisdom. It was a tough experience and I learned more about myself than the actual interviews.
<br><br>

Up until this point, the user research segment of the brainstorming phase took by far the most time. To conduct great user interviews means you have to have had acquired enough user research to begin with. Below are a few best practises and foundational work I followed in preparation for the user interviews:
- Create Research Goals
  - Purpose: To help guide the interview questions
  - Purpose: To help guide future design decisions
  - For Example: I want to understand common challenges people face when trying to manage a busy schedule and when meal planning.
- Determine Target Audience
  - And list key characteristics of the users they want to interview
- Write a list of interview questions in advance
  - Effective interview questions have 5 characteristics: They are relevant, open-ended, clear, neutral, and designed for follow-up.
  - For Example:
    - What is your current schedule like? How do you balance your responsibilities with meal planning?
    - What challenges do you face in the ordering process? **How do these challenges make you feel?**
      - The signifance of the last question is that there weren't specific words like "challenged/frustrated" being used because it's not open-ended anymore and it could potentially put the interviewee in position where the they might feel embarassed or offended. IOW be careful how you word your questions.
- _Pre-Interview Empathy Exercise_
  - To perform this exercise, take one of your user profiles, imagine yourself as [user] and try to anticipate:
    - How [user] might answer the interview questions. Make sure to write it down.
    - How [user’s] needs, challenges, and/or concerns will be addressed
<br>

Before journeying on my way to local businesses, I made sure I answered yes to all of the following:
### (Checklist) Are you ready to start recruiting participants? 
1. Have you determined the research goals? <br>
2. Have you written interview questions? <br>
3. Have you created a screener survey to find a representative sample of study participants? <br>

Following that, I developed empathy maps for each (useful) interviewee to help organize all the information I acquired from a single person. From there, I identified each user's pain points. End then finally, I marked off the end of the Brainstorming phase by grouping as much data as I could and building out 3 personas that in some way were a composure of some of the data collected from the plethora of info collected from the small business owners. <br><br>

To recap, the goal of the brainstorming phase is to gather insights about the users, their needs, and the opportunities for solving their problems. This is where activities like user interviews, surveys, and building personas take place.

# Phase 2: Define
At this point we are in the Define phase of the Product Development Life Cycle. In this phase, the insights gathered during research are synthesized and used to define the product's goals, user needs, and project scope. Key artifacts such as personas, user journeys, and problem statements are finalized here to ensure alignment between the user needs and the business objectives.
<br><br>

Note that most pain points fall into 4 categories:
1. Financial: User problems related to money. 
    - _Opening an article only to be blocked by a paywall_
2. Product: Quality issues related to the product. _Norman doors_
3. Process: Frustrations that stop the user going from point A to point B. 
    - _Shopping online and struggling to get the item you want to check out_
4. Support: When users interact with your product, they might have questions. If they can't find answers to their questions, they won't feel supported. 
    - _Customer service info that’s hidden on a website_


# Journal
### Oct. 22: 
To start with, I began this project in the beginning of October. As I write this, today is October 22, 2024. Note that throughout the last 3 weeks, I took some time off to work on other things in order to help build my career, hence why I'm not as far as I should be.

### Oct. 23: 
After collecting user data from my user interviews, I watched some more YouTube videos from UXers to gain insight as to whether I chose the right prompt to work on. Mind you, I really had one other prompt in mind provided by the course, which was prompt **#4: Design an app and a responsive eCommerce website that enable gamers to purchase gaming equipment.** The reason being is because I'm building a personal online brand myself - which is e-commerce related - so I thought that I could interchange "gaming equipment" with "clothing" and kill 2 birds with one stone. However after watching several YouTuber's videos they heavily emphasized not to do something e-commerce related; it's just the most generic thing out there next to food delivery app. <br>

If I went with #4, I would have built out a really cool and creative idea for an experience I wanted to develop. But first and foremost, in the context of UX Design and Product Design, **you want your product to fill a gap in the market or solve a problem better than existing products.** Also, **Jumping straight into design without any sort of logic or reasoning behind your design choices will result in a pretty... but pretty USELESS design.** <br>

That information helped me stick with my prompt. However, what convinced me most to stick with my prompt was simply making this GitHub repository and organizing, documenting my data and journey, as well as regurgitating what I learned from the Google UX Design Course.

### Oct. 25: 
I've been struggling at this stage a bit because in the UX course, I feel like the UXR part was went over very broadly, and from the brainstorming - it moved to persona building very quickly. I took the user interviews very seriously. That said, I threw myself in the deep end struggled with the research but I could definitely say I've acquired some knowledge myself of how to perform user research. <br>
Today and yesterday I was testing other popular business-management products for small business, though I initially searched "free invoicee tracking apps". I learned that the competitor products were all very complex and good apps, but they weren't _just_ invoice tracking apps; They were all made to manage an entire business, and the invoice/accounting section is a mere facet of the entire product. This is where I first seen an opportunity for me to create something simpler made just for invoice tracking (It gave me other ideas as well for betting apps). I also seen an opportunity that maybe I can create an invoice tracking apps for a younger demographic of people, particularly age range between ages 12-24. <br>

See with the current business-tracking apps out there, for a younger demographic, they don't need all that. I believe that they'd enjoy the feel of an incredibly easy-to-use, quick money-tracking application of some sort that focuses on one facet of a business. I think its a good idea to create an app that focuses on a group of related metrics of a business to help the youth get themselves a feel of financial organization. I think its also very important to find a way to spike their dopamine levels. I'm thinking of how in betting apps you feel so good after seeing green, or check marks. Maximize visuals and interactions whereever possible and minimize visuals when things don't go their way (e.g., if expense is made, reduce the amount of red whereever possible compared to when a payment is recieved to make them feel less bad). <br>

I'm still not done testing other products. I'd like to test between 2-3 other products at least. I feel stuck but that's because I was just blindly testing products without a workflow or a framework. In this research phase, the most experience I'd say I developed is being courageous and going up to people, delivering questions to them, presenting myself to them in a way where they can trust me enough to give me 5-10 minutes of their time and be open to answer my questions; and the second being that with competitor analysis, please create or follow a framework/workflow before blindly testing stuff, or you will get lost. 

### Oct. 26:
Today I will finish competitor analysis. I'm going to delve into at least 2-3 competitor apps and their mobile app counterpart. First, I begin the workflow by identifying what core functionality I want to test. Reminder that the project is about designing an app that helps small business owners send and track invoices for their services, and nothing more. A part of why I got stuck during competitive analysis as well is because I got overwhelmed at the complexity of the products that exist; I was noting down things beyond the scope of the project. 

## Competitor Analysis: Paymo
### 1. Testing Core Functionality 
Below are focal points of each product I will evaluate for their effectiveness and efficiency:
- Invoice creation
  - **Task Completion Speed:** How quickly can the user complete the invoice creation task?
  - **Repetition Management:** This is a commonly repeated task. What does the app do to streamline repetition?
  - **Cognitive Load:** Is there a cognitive load involved in this task?
  - **Interaction Costs:** How many clicks, screens, or inputs are required to create a standard invoice?
  - **Effectiveness Indicators:** What elements enhance or detract from the overall ease of invoice creation?
  - **Error prevention and correction:** Does the app prevent common user errors or provide useful feedback when they occur?
  - **Personalization:** Does the app allow templates or auto-population of recurring information, saving users time?
- Payment tracking
  - **Task Simplification:** Does the app make it easy to distinguish between paid, unpaid, and overdue invoices at a glance?
  - **Cognitive Load:** How intuitively are payment statuses displayed? Are users likely to understand statuses without extra interpretation?
  - **Interaction Costs:** How much effort is required to update payment statuses or view details on a payment’s history?
  - **Usability and Effectiveness:** Do design elements (like color-coding, labels, or grouped actions) assist the user in tracking and managing payments effectively?
  - **Notifications and Alerts:** Are reminders or alerts sent for overdue payments or upcoming due dates? How are these alerts displayed, and can they be customized?
- Expense overview
  - **Information Layout:** Are expenses broken down logically (e.g., by category, date, or project) to minimize search time?
  - **Cognitive Load:** Does the layout support quick understanding, or does it overwhelm the user with unnecessary details?
  - **Interaction Costs:** Are there minimal steps to filter, sort, or add new expenses?
  - **Effectiveness:** How well does the visual hierarchy (e.g., use of whitespace, bold fonts, icons) support users’ comprehension of expenses?
- Reporting capabilities (generating summaries or visualizations of financial data)
  - **Task Clarity:** How easily can users generate reports or summaries for financial data?
  - **Cognitive Load:** Are options for customization (e.g., date range, data type) accessible and clear?
  - **Interaction Costs:** Are there extra steps or confusing settings involved in creating meaningful reports?
  - **Effectiveness in Visual Design:** Are the visualizations (charts, graphs) easy to interpret? Is there flexibility in format without compromising simplicity?

### 2. Analyzing Additional Patterns and Interaction Optimization
Document recurring UX/UI patterns that are small business-friendly and evaluate how these patterns add value to the user experience such as:

- **Simplification of Repetitive Tasks Across Features**
  - Reusability: Can templates, autofill options, or data pre-population enhance speed and reduce errors?
  - Consistency in Interaction: Do similar tasks (e.g., adding an expense vs. creating an invoice) follow consistent interaction patterns
- **Mobile Interaction Enhancement**
  - Responsiveness and Adaptability: How well does the mobile experience retain core functionality without overwhelming smaller screens?
  - Gesture and Touch Optimization: Are primary actions optimized for mobile interactions, such as swipe actions, tap zones, and simplified input fields?
- **Error Prevention and Support**
  - Error Feedback: How effectively does the app prevent user errors (e.g., invalid entries, missed fields) and provide actionable guidance
  - Supportive Prompts and Tutorials: Is there in-context help to guide users through complex tasks without disrupting their flow?

### 3. Identify Strengths, Pain Points, and Opportunities for Optimization
Provides a structured overview of the strengths, pain points, and opportunities for optimization within each core function of the Paymo app. Highlight key insights from the competitor analysis to guide design improvements for a more user-friendly, efficient invoicing and payment tracking experience.

### 4. Conclusion: Synthesize UX Pattern Findings into Actionable Insights
Create a stakeholder-ready synthesis of your competitive analysis findings with actionable insights based on UX patterns.

### Oct. 27-28
I did NOT finish competitor analysis. To be fair, I got a bit distracted from the last two days, but besides that, me being as productive as I can be today, I learned that a competitor analysis is incredibly time consuming. It has so far involved:
- Note taking
- critiquing every detail of the product
- journaling how I feel at the given moment using a specific feature
- pushing a product to its limits; trying to break the product

But your assessment is as good as your questions. So learning to ask better questions is also involved.

### Oct. 31
I finished the competitive analysis today. This took _way_ longer than expected. But you know what? I feel so much more confident going into the Define phase having studied a successful app catered for small business owners. More specifically, I studied the Paymo app, which according to reviews is the highest rated business management app for small business owners. Despite it being the highest rated, I was able to determine a plethora of features that could be optimized. I found a few things that didn't work as intended. I learned about the design & interaction patterns that make the app so effective and fluid to use. I learned the ins-and-outs of a successful app design. <br>

Why re-invent the wheel? Reminder that the goal of this project was to design an app and a responsive website that helps small business owners send and track invoices for their services. After completing the competitive analysis (along with user research), I learned that I don't need to exhaust my time and effort into creating something from scratch. I can take what already works in this world while avoid the flaws I learned about to create something hopefully better, and there's nothing wrong with that.

### Nov. 1
#### Purpose of the Competitive Analysis
I want to conclude the competitive analysis phase by saying that the purpose in conducting the competitive analysis was to deeply understand how existing invoicing and payment tracking apps serve small business owners, focusing on the usability, efficiency, and accessibility of core functions. I aimed to identify both effective UX patterns and areas for improvement, with the goal of informing my own design choices. By pinpointing strengths, pain points, and opportunities for optimization, I built a foundation for designing a more intuitive, user-friendly product that simplifies financial management for small business owners. This approach not only hones my UX skills but also aligns my design with real user needs and industry best practices.
