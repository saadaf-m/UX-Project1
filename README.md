# Google UX Project 1
The purpose of this repository is to track and journal my progress building out a UX Design project following Google's UX Design Certificate course on Coursera. Throughout this project in particular, I will apply _The Design Thinking Framework_ on top of the _Product Development Life Cycle_ as a guideline to build out the product. 

To recap, the Design Thinking Framework is a user-centered approach to problem-solving that consists of the phases: 
- Empathize
- Define
- Ideate
- Prototype
- Test
  
But note that this is cyclical, just like the PDLC. Recap the stages of the PDLC:
- Brainstorm
- Define
- Design
- Test
- Launch
  
<br>
I will treat this repository informally, like a journal.

# Phase 1: Brainstorm
The brainstorming phase is when the team starts thinking of an idea for a product. This was partially done for me considering that the course highly suggested that I select a prompt from a list of 25 prompts so that I can best follow along with the course. I selected **#21: Design an app and a responsive website that help small business owners send and track invoices for their services.** But beyond that, the rest was on my shoulders. After I decided on a prompt, next was to begin identifying problems that I wanted to solve. So, I initiated this segment by researching into product competitors to identify if there already exists similar products available in the market. While doing so I kept in mind the importance in which that **You want your product to fill a gap in the market or solve a problem better than existing products.**
<br><br>
Researching into product competitors helped me further develop my understanding of business management a bit better, but it wasn't enough to help me discover pain points considering I'm not yet a small business owner myself. Therefore, on top of the product competitor analysis, I had to conduct user research as well. I took the opportunity to conduct user interviews with real small business owners in real stores in my local area. 
<br><br> On a side note, I genuinely enjoyed conducting user interviews in real life. I learned more about myself than the product I was developing, but don't let that statement take away from how much information I acquired from the user interview process!!
<br><br>
Up until this point, the user research segment of the brainstorming phase took by far the most time. To conduct great user interviews means you have to have had acquired enough user research to begin with. Below are a few best practises and foundational work I followed in preparation for the user interviews:
- Create Research Goals
  - Purpose: To help guide the interview questions
  - Purpose: To help guide future design decisions
  - For Example: I want to understand common challenges people face when trying to manage a busy schedule and when meal planning.
- Determine Target Audience
  - And list key characteristics of the users they want to interview
- Write a list of interview questions in advance
  - Effective interview questions have 5 characteristics: They are relevant, open-ended, clear, neutral, and designed for follow-up.
  - For Example:
    - What is your current schedule like? How do you balance your responsibilities with meal planning?
    - What challenges do you face in the ordering process? **How do these challenges make you feel?**
      - The signifance of the last question is that there weren't specific words like "challenged/frustrated" being used because it's not open-ended anymore and it could potentially put the interviewee in position where the they might feel embarassed or offended. IOW be careful how you word your questions.
- _Pre-Interview Empathy Exercise_
  - To perform this exercise, take one of your user profiles, imagine yourself as [user] and try to anticipate:
    - How [user] might answer the interview questions. Make sure to write it down.
    - How [user’s] needs, challenges, and/or concerns will be addressed
<br>

Before journeying on my way to local businesses, I made sure I answered yes to all of the following:
### (Checklist) Are you ready to start recruiting participants? 
1. Have you determined the research goals? <br>
2. Have you written interview questions? <br>
3. Have you created a screener survey to find a representative sample of study participants? <br>

Following that, I developed empathy maps for each (useful) interviewee to help organize all the information I acquired from a single person. From there, I identified each user's pain points. End then finally, I marked off the end of the Brainstorming phase by grouping as much data as I could and building out 3 personas that in some way were a composure of some of the data collected from the plethora of info collected from the small business owners. <br><br>

To recap, the goal of the brainstorming phase is to gather insights about the users, their needs, and the opportunities for solving their problems. This is where activities like user interviews, surveys, and building personas take place.

# Phase 2: Define
At this point we are in the Define phase of the Product Development Life Cycle. In this phase, the insights gathered during research are synthesized and used to define the product's goals, user needs, and project scope. Key artifacts such as personas, user journeys, and problem statements are finalized here to ensure alignment between the user needs and the business objectives.
<br><br>

Note that most pain points fall into 4 categories:
1. Financial: User problems related to money. 
    - _Opening an article only to be blocked by a paywall_
2. Product: Quality issues related to the product. _Norman doors_
3. Process: Frustrations that stop the user going from point A to point B. 
    - _Shopping online and struggling to get the item you want to check out_
4. Support: When users interact with your product, they might have questions. If they can't find answers to their questions, they won't feel supported. 
    - _Customer service info that’s hidden on a website_


# Journal
### Oct. 22: 
To start with, I began this project in the beginning of October. As I write this, today is October 22, 2024. Note that throughout the last 3 weeks, I took some time off to work on other things in order to help build my career, hence why I'm not as far as I should be.

### Oct. 23: 
After collecting user data from my user interviews, I watched some more YouTube videos from UXers to gain insight as to whether I chose the right prompt to work on. Mind you, I really had one other prompt in mind provided by the course, which was prompt **#4: Design an app and a responsive eCommerce website that enable gamers to purchase gaming equipment.** The reason being is because I'm building a personal online brand myself - which is e-commerce related - so I thought that I could interchange "gaming equipment" with "clothing" and kill 2 birds with one stone. However after watching several YouTuber's videos they heavily emphasized not to do something e-commerce related; it's just the most generic thing out there next to food delivery app. <br><br>

If I went with #4, I would have built out a really cool and creative idea for an experience I wanted to develop. But first and foremost, in the context of UX Design and Product Design, **you want your product to fill a gap in the market or solve a problem better than existing products.** Also, **Jumping straight into design without any sort of logic or reasoning behind your design choices will result in a pretty... but pretty USELESS design.** <br><br>

That information helped me stick with my prompt. However, what convinced me most to stick with my prompt was simply making this GitHub repository and organizing, documenting my data and journey, as well as regurgitating what I learned from the Google UX Design Course.

### Oct. 25: 
I've been struggling at this stage a bit because in the UX course, I feel like the UXR part was went over very broadly, and from the brainstorming - it moved to persona building very quickly. I took the user interviews very seriously. That said, I threw myself in the deep end struggled with the research but I could definitely say I've acquired some knowledge myself of how to perform user research. <br><br>

Today and yesterday I was testing other popular business-management products for small business, though I initially searched "free invoicee tracking apps". I learned that the competitor products were all very complex and good apps, but they weren't _just_ invoice tracking apps; They were all made to manage an entire business, and the invoice/accounting section is a mere facet of the entire product. This is where I first seen an opportunity for me to create something simpler made just for invoice tracking (It gave me other ideas as well for betting apps). I also seen an opportunity that maybe I can create an invoice tracking apps for a younger demographic of people, particularly age range between ages 12-24. <br><br>

See with the current business-tracking apps out there, for a younger demographic, they don't need all that. I believe that they'd enjoy the feel of an incredibly easy-to-use, quick money-tracking application of some sort that focuses on one facet of a business. I think its a good idea to create an app that focuses on a group of related metrics of a business to help the youth get themselves a feel of financial organization. I think its also very important to find a way to spike their dopamine levels. I'm thinking of how in betting apps you feel so good after seeing green, or check marks. Maximize visuals and interactions whereever possible and minimize visuals when things don't go their way (e.g., if expense is made, reduce the amount of red whereever possible compared to when a payment is recieved to make them feel less bad). <br><br>

I'm still not done testing other products. I'd like to test between 2-3 other products at least. I feel stuck but that's because I was just blindly testing products without a workflow or a framework. In this research phase, the most experience I'd say I developed is being courageous and going up to people, delivering questions to them, presenting myself to them in a way where they can trust me enough to give me 5-10 minutes of their time and be open to answer my questions; and the second being that with competitor analysis, please create or follow a framework/workflow before blindly testing stuff, or you will get lost. 

### Oct. 26:
Today I will finish competitor analysis. I'm going to delve into at least 2-3 competitor apps and their mobile app counterpart. First, I begin the workflow by identifying what core functionality I want to test. Reminder that the project is about designing an app that helps small business owners send and track invoices for their services, and nothing more. A part of why I got stuck during competitive analysis as well is because I got overwhelmed at the complexity of the products that exist; I was noting down things beyond the scope of the project. 

### 1. Testing Core Functionality 
Below are focal points of each product I will evaluate for their effectiveness and efficiency:
- Invoice creation
  - Test speed of this task
  - This is a common repeated task. What does the app do to streamline repition?
  - Is there a cognitive load involved in this task?
  - Are there any interaction costs involved with this task?
  - What parts of this task do you see effectiveness of the design stand out?
  - Error prevention and correction: Does the app prevent common user errors (like duplicate entries) or provide useful feedback when they occur?
  - Personalization: Does the app allow templates or auto-population of recurring information, saving users time?
- Payment tracking
  - Task Simplification: Does the app make it easy to distinguish between paid, unpaid, and overdue invoices at a glance?
  - Cognitive Load: How intuitively are payment statuses displayed? Are users likely to understand statuses without extra interpretation?
  - Interaction Costs: How much effort is required to update payment statuses or view details on a payment’s history?
  - Usability and Effectiveness: Do design elements (like color coding, labels, or grouped actions) assist the user in tracking and managing payments effectively?
  - Notifications and Alerts: Are reminders or alerts sent for overdue payments or upcoming due dates? How are these alerts displayed, and can they be customized?
- Expense overview
  - Is there a cognitive load involved in this task?
  - Are there any interaction costs involved with this task?
  - What parts of this task do you see effectiveness of the design stand out?
- Reporting capabilities (generating summaries or visualizations of financial data)
  - Are there any interaction costs involved with this task?

### 2. Analyzing User Interface and Interaction Patterns
- Document recurring UX/UI patterns that are small business-friendly and evaluate how these patterns add value to the user experience such as:
  - quick-access buttons
  - quick-action menu
  - status icons
  - dashboard summaries
  - dynamic search and filtering
  - personalized insights
    - (e.g., highest-paying client, profit/expenses today/last wk, profit/expenses today vs. yday, etc.)
  - Tooltips
  - Mobile: Is it mobile-friendly?
    - Does it have elements like larger buttons?
    - Is the navigation simplified?
    - Are common actions easy to access or streamlined?
- Take note of colour coding for status updates and evaluate how this adds value to the user experience.
- Take note of layout choices that aid in quick decision-making and evaluate how this adds value to the user experience.
  - How easily could a non-expert navigate and complete tasks?
 
### 3. Assess Accessibility and Mobile Optimization
- Is the usability on mobile and desktop equally intuitive?
- Is the mobile workflow of tasks more optimized? When answering, consider:
  - Simplified navigation?
  - Task execution requires equal or less clicks?
- Are there any features that enhance mobile interaction? (Note that by "enhance", I mean designing features or layouts that make using the app on mobile devices easy, efficient, and enjoyable. For example for an invoicing app, this involves adapting the interface to support tasks on smaller screens and touch interactions, ensuring that the experience is smooth and free from common mobile usability issues.) Below describe some features and layouts that improve or "enhance" mobile interaction:
  - Responsive Layout: Does it adapt to various screen sizes, use touch-friendly buttons, larger fonts?
  - Sticky Navigation
  - Gesture-Based Interaction: Does it have swipe-to-delete or swipe-to-archive type actions?
  - Quick-Add Buttons: Floating "+" button without having to navigate to another screen? Predict next interaction?
  - Thumb-Friendly Design

### 4. Identify Strengths, Pain Points, and Opportunities for Optimization
- Make a list of standout features or strengths and make another list for friction points or overly complex workflows.
  - For each pt. in list 2, consider: Are ways that each point could be simplified without sacrificing functionality?
- Highlight any gaps where an opportunity exists to improve or simplify the experience.

### 5. Conclusion: Synthesize UX Pattern Findings into Actionable Insights
- Summarize common patterns or design approaches that provide a strong user experience **for** small business owners.
  - Common patterns/design approaches such as the use of icons, navigation layouts, dashboard configurations that prioritize clarity.
- Note unique or creative solutions that competitors use to address small busines challenges (e.g., quick-glance financial summary). These can inform potential features or patterns that you could adapt to your design.
